POWER BI

Reporting project, The report will be built in Power BI.

For this project I will be using PowerBI to help share data that the devices gather overtime through visualisations built into a report or dashboard.

The usage of the IoT devices, as well as their statuses can be managed through the following reports:

    * High-Level Metrics
    * Device Monitoring 
    * Device Registration
