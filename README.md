# POWER BI

   Reporting project, The report will be built in Power BI.

   For this project I will be using PowerBI to help share data that the devices gather overtime through visualisations built into a report or dashboard.

   The usage of the IoT devices, as well as their statuses can be managed through the following reports:

    * High-Level Metrics
    * Device Monitoring 
    * Device Registration

# High-Level Metrics

    This is a report that shows how counts of data points based on information could impact decision making and it looks like this:

# Device Monitoring
In this page(report), the user can:

      * monitor devices per category
      * monitor devices per zone
      * monitor online versus offline devices (status should depict whether a device is online or offline)

# Device Registration
In this page(report), the user can use the visuals to view: 
      
      * how many devices have been registered over a timespan
      * how many categories of devices have been created
      * how many zones contain registered devices on a timeline

# Filtering

I also made use of filters that can be applied across pages and visuals
The filtering can be used to:

      * filter the report based on device category
      * filter the report based on device platform
      * filter the report based on device zone
      * filter the report based on device registration date
